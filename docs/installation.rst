Installation
============

Installation should be done with `composer <http://getcomposer.org/>`_ by adding this library to your ``composer.json`` file::

    "require": {
        "joshuaestes/feature-toggle": "~0.1"
    }

You can also add this to your ``composer.json`` file using composer's `require <http://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#require>`_ command like so::

    php composer.phar require "joshuaestes/feature-toggle:~0.1"
